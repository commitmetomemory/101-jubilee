            <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>I've made my home base in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with my family and my two cats. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism, then English. After I received my Masters in Library and Information Science and started my career as a librarian I began to make games online that relied on code. As I learned more about it, I was fascinated with how easily I could translate my illustrations and designs to  web designs. There is nothing quite like the thrill of learning how to build a space online that fits my needs perfectly.</p>

          <div class="half-width">
            <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

            <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
            <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is acciessible and easy to read, collaborate, and trouble-shoot.</p>

            <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
            <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

            <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code
</h3>
            <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.
